# Achieving-a-Neutral-Carbon-Footprint-for-Electrical-Substations

Implementation of the paper "Achieving-a-Neutral-Carbon-Footprint-for-Electrical-Substations" by Soham Ghosh and Jamar Sullivan.

Key ‘Highlights’ for the article titled ‘Towards Achieving a Neutral Carbon Footprint for Electrical Substations’ are listed below.
1. Global focus on operational decarbonization: Government incentives in the U.S. and worldwide are driving efforts to reduce emissions in electrical utilities, particularly in the substation sector.

2. AI-optimized sustainable concrete: Reinforcement learning techniques are used to develop high-strength concrete mixes with a lower carbon footprint.

3. Waste heat recovery innovation: A novel Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based system is proposed to harness waste heat from large power transformers.

4. Enhanced SF6 leak detection: Temperature-compensated pressure sensing enables faster SF6 leak detection, allowing for precise corrective measures.

The codes are arranged in four sections and align with the flow of the manuscript. The sections are:

Section 1 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Concrete Mix Design

Section 2 ORC Efficiency for Different Working Fluids

Section 3 SF6 Breaker Leakage  Data

Section 4 EPA SF6 Alternative Benefit Calculator
